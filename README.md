<h2 align="center">Features</h2>

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - Start by creating the basic structure of your HTML document with the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.
   - Use semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to structure your page's content.

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - Define the CSS styles for your webpage. Make sure to match the color scheme and layout you have in mind.
   - Use external CSS files linked in the `<head>` of your HTML document or include inline styles within HTML elements.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Use CSS media queries to make your webpage responsive to different screen sizes and devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
   - Adjust font sizes, padding, margins, and other CSS properties to ensure the layout adapts smoothly to different screen widths.

4. **Images**:
   - Optimize images for web use to ensure they load quickly without pixelation.
   - Use CSS to control image size and positioning. You can set the `max-width` property to ensure images don't stretch beyond their natural size.

5. **Text Overflow**:
   - To prevent text overflow, you can use CSS properties like `overflow` and `text-overflow`.
   - Consider using `@media` queries to adjust font sizes or line heights for smaller screens if necessary.

6. **Testing**:
   - Test your webpage in various browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
   - Test on different devices and screen sizes to verify its responsiveness.
   - Check for any layout issues when zooming in or out.
